title:  Welcome to My Coding Journey!
---
Hello! My name is Kamal Dabban, and I’m a 3rd-year computer engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I’m still a beginner in the world of coding, learning several programming languages like Java, MATLAB, Python, C, and Assembly. A few months ago, I didn’t even know how to write a line of HTML, but now, I’m diving into web development and documenting everything along the way.

This blog will be a place where I share the small projects I’ve worked on, the challenges I face, and the lessons I learn as I grow as a programmer. Whether you’re also just starting or further along in your coding journey, I hope you’ll find something helpful or inspiring here.

Even though I’m new to GitHub and still learning, I’m excited to share my experience and connect with others. Feel free to leave a comment or share your thoughts—I’d love to hear about your coding experiences too!
